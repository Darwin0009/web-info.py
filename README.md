# web-info.py
simple script that analyzes the web and provides information about it


This script is a web header detector that retrieves and displays the headers of a specified target URL. It uses the requests library for making HTTP requests and the argparse module for command-line argument parsing.The main functionality of the script is encapsulated within a main function. The user can specify the target URL using the -t or --target command-line argument. The script then attempts to retrieve the headers of the specified URL. If successful, it prints the headers to the console in the format "HeaderName: HeaderValue." If there are any issues during the request, such as failure to reach the target URL, it provides an appropriate error message.The script is designed to be user-friendly, providing feedback when the target URL is missing or when errors occur during the HTTP request.
